# Configee for PHP! 

## What is it?
This is a php library that you can add to any project to help you manage
application specific php config files, such as database connection parameters.
For example, if you were creating a PHP framework, you'd want anyone using your
project to be able to define their own config parameters for connecting to their
own database.

## What is the purpose?
The purpose is to have a dead simple interface for setting and getting
configuration parameters by only having to define config files.
